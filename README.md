We were given the task to create a quiz app for history students. My app has 3 screens.
screen 1:
Name of app and start button
screen 2:
questions, true, false and next button and feedback "correct" or "incorrect"
screen 3:
score, a review and buttons which incluse an exit button that will take you to the first screen
